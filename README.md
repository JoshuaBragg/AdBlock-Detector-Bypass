## AdBlock-Detector-Bypass

A chrome extension that removes the obtrusive popup that prevents you from viewing webpage content when an adblocker is detected, and all in page popups in general.

When a popup appears simply click the extension icon to remove the popup and continue reading the article.

Install the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-detector-bypass/acjlefdefjkldgcimnfkehgbnpjekedo)

This is sure to work on most websites from my experience.

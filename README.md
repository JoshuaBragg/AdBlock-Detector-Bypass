## AdBlock-Detector-Bypass

A firefox extension that removes the obtrusive popup that prevents you from viewing webpage content when an adblocker is detected, and all in page popups in general.

When a popup appears simply click the extension icon to remove the popup and continue reading the article.


To download this extension, go to the latest release and download the .xpi file. It is signed by Mozilla, or click [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-detector-bypass/)

This is sure to work on most websites from my experience.


I made this because the original extension was very cool and I like to use it. As soon as I heard that Chrome is removing Manifest V2, which is used in this extension, I releasised that Firefox was not. So then I ported this to Firefox.

## AdBlock-Detector-Bypass

A firefox extension that removes the obtrusive popup that prevents you from viewing webpage content when an adblocker is detected, and all in page popups in general.

When a popup appears simply click the extension icon to remove the popup and continue reading the article.

Install the .crx file from the assets to run. I have requested for this to be put up on AMO, nothing received yet.

This is sure to work on most websites from my experience.

## AdBlock-Detector-Bypass

A firefox extension that removes the obtrusive popup that prevents you from viewing webpage content when an adblocker is detected, and all in page popups in general.

When a popup appears simply click the extension icon to remove the popup and continue reading the article.

I have requested AMO for a .xpi file. Hang on. 
This is sure to work on most websites from my experience.


I made this because the original extension was very cool and I like to use it. As soon as I heard that Chrome is removing Manifest V2, which is used in this extension, I releasised that Firefox was not. So then I ported this to Firefox.
